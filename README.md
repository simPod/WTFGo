# WTF Go

While learning about golang, I stubled upon many things that don't make much sense compared to other languages. 
The language has IMO high WTF factor. 
I want to list those WTFs so it either reminds me to get understanding of it or to serve as a strawman so I don't get tempted to touch the language.
